In this project, I have used the below artichture to solve the given Architeccture.

d explore whether the current architecture is capable of achieving even higher rewards in the same environment, pushing the agent to reach a more optimal solution.

## Potential Improvements:
Negative Rewards for Inefficient Actions: Introducing negative rewards for actions that move the agent away from its goal (i.e., chasing yellow bananas) could discourage random or exploratory moves that are not aligned with optimal behavior.

Exploring Other Algorithms: There are several advanced algorithms that could potentially outperform the current Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture. Implementing these methods and comparing their performance in the same environment would be an interesting area of exploration. Possible algorithms to investigate include:

A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic): A popular policy-based algorithm that uses multiple agents learning asynchronously, which can lead to faster and more stable learning.
Noisy DQN: A variant of DQN that incorporates noise into the network, encouraging better exploration by introducing stochasticity into the action-selection process.
Distributional DQN: An extension of DQN that models the distribution of returns rather than just the expected value, potentially leading to a richer understanding of the environment's reward structure.
By implementing these algorithms, future work could assess whether they offer performance improvements or faster convergence compared to the current approach.
